End Users	               -  Individuals or organizations tracking health data.	                      - Accurate tracking of health metrics (steps, heart rate, calories burned).	      - Lack of a simple, lightweight system for tracking health data.                            	- 90% user satisfaction with the system's ease of use and accuracy.
Developers               -  Engineers building and maintaining the system.	                          - Easy-to-maintain codebase with clear documentation.                            	- Lack of modularity in existing systems, making updates difficult.                         	- 100% adherence to coding standards and documentation completeness.
System Administrators     -	IT staff responsible for deploying and managing the system.	              - Easy deployment and monitoring of the system.                                   - Complex deployment processes in existing systems.                                         	- Deployment time reduced by 50%.
Health Researchers        -	Researchers analyzing aggregated health data.	                            - Access to accurate and aggregated health metrics for analysis.	                - Lack of a centralized system for collecting and analyzing health data.	                    - 100% accuracy in aggregated health data.
Product Managers	        - Oversee the development and alignment of the system with business goals.	- System meets user needs and is delivered on time and within budget.	            - Misalignment between user needs and system capabilities.	                                  - 100% of functional requirements delivered within the project timeline.
Security Auditors        -	Ensure the system complies with security standards.                      	- User data is secure and complies with privacy regulations.	                    - Lack of encryption and secure data handling in existing systems.	                          - 100% compliance with AES-256 encryption and GDPR/other privacy regulati

2. Functional Requirements

Add Health Data

The system shall allow users to add health data (steps, heart rate, calories burned) for a specific user.

Acceptance Criteria: Data is stored in an in-memory HashMap and can be retrieved without errors.

View Health Data

The system shall allow users to view health data for a specific user.

Acceptance Criteria: Health data is displayed in a readable format (e.g., HealthData { steps: 5000, heart_rate: 80, calories_burned: 300 }).

Calculate Totals

The system shall calculate and display the total steps, heart rate, and calories burned across all users.

Acceptance Criteria: Totals are computed accurately and displayed in real time.

User Authentication

The system shall allow users to authenticate before accessing health data.

Acceptance Criteria: Only authenticated users can add, view, or calculate health data.

Data Persistence

The system shall persist health data to a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL).

Acceptance Criteria: Data is retrievable after system restart.

Search Health Data

The system shall allow users to search for health data by user name.

Acceptance Criteria: Search results display health data within 2 seconds.

Export Health Data

The system shall allow users to export health data to a CSV file.

Acceptance Criteria: CSV file contains accurate and complete health data.

Real-Time Notifications

The system shall notify users when their health metrics exceed predefined thresholds.

Acceptance Criteria: Notifications are delivered in real time via email or SMS.

Multi-Platform Support

The system shall support deployment on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Acceptance Criteria: The system runs without errors on all supported platforms.

API Integration

The system shall provide a REST API for integrating with third-party applications.

Acceptance Criteria: API endpoints are documented and accessible via HTTP requests.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

4. Documentation & Clarity
This document provides a clear and structured overview of the Health Tracker System's requirements. Each requirement is specific, unambiguous, and traceable to stakeholder needs. The document is organized into:

Stakeholder Analysis: Identifies key stakeholders, their concerns, and success metrics.

Functional Requirements: Defines system capabilities with acceptance criteria.

Non-Functional Requirements: Categorizes quality attributes into usability, deployability, maintainability, scalability, security, and performance.
