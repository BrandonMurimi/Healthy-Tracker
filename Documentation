Product Managers	        - Oversee the development and alignment of the system with business goals.	- System meets user needs and is delivered on time and within budget.	            - Misalignment between user needs and system capabilities.	                                  - 100% of functional requirements delivered within the project timeline.
Security Auditors        -	Ensure the system complies with security standards.                      	- User data is secure and complies with privacy regulations.	                    - Lack of encryption and secure data handling in existing systems.	                          - 100% compliance with AES-256 encryption and GDPR/other privacy regulati

2. Functional Requirements

Add Health Data

The system shall allow users to add health data (steps, heart rate, calories burned) for a specific user.

Acceptance Criteria: Data is stored in an in-memory HashMap and can be retrieved without errors.

View Health Data

The system shall allow users to view health data for a specific user.

Acceptance Criteria: Health data is displayed in a readable format (e.g., HealthData { steps: 5000, heart_rate: 80, calories_burned: 300 }).

Calculate Totals

The system shall calculate and display the total steps, heart rate, and calories burned across all users.

Acceptance Criteria: Totals are computed accurately and displayed in real time.
