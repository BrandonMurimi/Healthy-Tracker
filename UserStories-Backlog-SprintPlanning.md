Justification for Prioritization
- **Must-have**: Stories critical for the MVP, such as tracking steps (US-001), viewing data (US-002), and setting goals (US-003), align with stakeholder success metrics for usability and core functionality.
- **Should-have**: Stories like generating reports (US-005) and managing users (US-006) enhance the system but are not essential for the MVP.
- **Could-have**: Stories like analyzing trends (US-008) provide additional value but can be deferred to later sprints.
- **Won’t-have**: No stories are classified as "Won’t-have" at this stage.
